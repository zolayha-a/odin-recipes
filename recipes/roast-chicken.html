  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Get ready to fall in love with roast chicken all over again! This is the
    kind of recipe that turns a simple Sunday dinner into a celebration.
    Imagine: tender, juicy chicken beneath a shatteringly crisp, golden skin,
    bathed in a buttery, herb-infused pan sauce that’s so good, you’ll want to
    drizzle it over everything on your plate. Each bite bursts with the warmth
    of roasted garlic, the freshness of garden herbs, and just a whisper of
    lemon—enough to brighten every mouthful without stealing the show.
    <br />
    This is more than just a roast chicken; it’s comfort food at its finest, the
    kind of meal you’ll crave on chilly evenings or when you want to impress
    friends and family. The best part? As the chicken roasts, it creates its own
    “liquid gold”—those irresistible pan juices that double as the perfect,
    no-fuss sauce. Inspired by my wildly popular Herb and Garlic Butter Roasted
    Turkey Breast, this chicken version is destined to become your new go-to
    recipe, whether it’s for a special occasion or a cozy weeknight at home.
    Once you try it, you’ll understand why this is the roast chicken you’ll make
    again and again!
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 whole chicken (4-5lbs)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>½ tsp of Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C), place a baking rack in the lower ⅓ of the oven, and bring the chicken to room temperature. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels.</li>
    <li>Place the chicken breast side up in an oven-safe pan (I prefer cast iron). Truss the legs. Drizzle with oil and use your hands to rub it all over the chicken.</li> 
    <li>Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, patting the seasoning in with your hands.</li>
    <li>Roast the chicken for 70 to 90 minutes, or until the juices run clear. Double check doneness with an instant-read thermometer placed in the thickest part of the thigh. It should read 165°F (74°C). Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes on a cutting board before slicing and serving.</li>
  </ol>
